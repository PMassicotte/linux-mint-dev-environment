# QGIS and gdal

## QGIS

Linux Mint is a bit behind for all the GIS stuff. I had problems (ex.: open cloud optimized geotiff on internet) with a old version of gdal that comes with Mint.

To update to a newer version of gdal, [install this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugis/+archive/ubuntu/ubuntugis-unstable):

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt update
```

Then, the [latest version of QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html):

```bash
wget -qO - https://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2021.gpg.key | sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/qgis-archive.gpg --import

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/qgis-archive.gpg

sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://qgis.org/ubuntu $(lsb_release -c -s) main"

sudo apt update

sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

Not tested: use `focal`, because `$(lsb_release -c -s)` returns `una` as codename.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://qgis.org/ubuntu focal main"
```

Add the following to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources` (replace `Suites: kinetic` based on your distro):

```bash
Types: deb deb-src
URIs: https://qgis.org/debian
Suites: kinetic
Architectures: amd64
Components: main
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg
```

## GDAL

Download the [latest version of gdal](https://gdal.org/download.html). Then [configure and install](https://gdal.org/build_hints.html#build-hints):

```bash
tar xvf gdal-3.6.2.tar.gz
cd gdal-3.6.2
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/bin -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```

Note, I needed to install `libpsl-dev`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpsl-dev
```

After installation, you might want to reinstall R packages that depend on GDAL, such as `sf` and `terra`.

```r
# Force installation from source with build options
# This ensures packages are compiled from source code rather than using pre-compiled binaries

# Set repository (optional but recommended for consistency)
repos <- "https://cloud.r-project.org"

# Install packages from source with specific build options
install.packages(
  c("terra", "sf"),
  type = "source",
  repos = repos,
  configure.args = list(
    sf = "--with-proj-lib=/usr/local/lib/",
    terra = "--with-gdal-config=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config"
  ),
  INSTALL_opts = c("--no-multiarch", "--with-keep.source")
)
```
