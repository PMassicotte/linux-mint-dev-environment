# Visual Studio Code

## Using VScode for R development

On Linux Mint, the default R installation directory is not the same as on Ubuntu. I have configured VScode to use the R bin installation directory of Ubuntu. Hence, on Mint, code completion, help viewer are not working. The simple work around is to create a symbolic link?

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R
```
